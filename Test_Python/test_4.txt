Algorithm Questions

1.
Regularization techniques add a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging overly complex models:

L1 Regularization (Lasso): Adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function. It tends to shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection and simplifying the model.
L2 Regularization (Ridge): Adds the square of the coefficients to the loss function. It reduces the magnitude of all coefficients, distributing the penalty evenly and maintaining all features while controlling their impact.

Both methods reduce the risk of overfitting by limiting the model's complexity.

2.
Gradient descent relies on the magnitude of the gradient to optimize the loss function. When features have different scales:

Features with large values dominate, causing slower convergence.
Unscaled features may lead to erratic optimization paths, complicating convergence. Feature scaling (e.g., standardization or normalization) ensures all features contribute equally to the optimization process, speeding up convergence.

Problem Solving

1.
Identify missing values: Use methods like .isnull() or .info() in pandas.
Imputation:

Numerical: Replace with mean, median, or mode.
Categorical: Replace with mode or a placeholder.
Remove rows/columns: Drop rows/columns if missing values are significant.
Advanced methods: Use predictive imputation techniques like k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or regression-based imputation.

2.
Step 1: Data Collection

Gather raw data from sources like CSV files, databases, or APIs.

Step 2: Data Cleaning

Handle missing values.
Remove duplicate records.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
Scale numerical features (e.g., standardization or normalization).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Step 4: Model Training

Select and train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).

Step 5: Model Evaluation

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Step 6: Deployment

Save the model using libraries like joblib or pickle.

Coding

1.
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

2.
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('my_dataset.csv')  # Replace with actual file path
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)  # Replace 'target_column' with actual target column
y = data['target_column']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print(f"Training set size: {len(X_train)}")
print(f"Testing set size: {len(X_test)}")

Case Study

Scenario: A company wants to predict employee attrition.

Type of ML Problem:

It is a binary classification problem (e.g., predicting "Attrition" as Yes/No).

Algorithms:

Logistic Regression: Simple and interpretable, good for binary classification.
Random Forest: Handles complex patterns, robust against overfitting, and provides feature importance.
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM): Provides high accuracy by combining weak learners.

Justification:

If interpretability is crucial, Logistic Regression is preferred.
If performance on imbalanced data is required, Random Forest or Gradient Boosting works well with class weights or oversampling.
