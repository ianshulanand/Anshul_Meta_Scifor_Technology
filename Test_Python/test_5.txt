Statistics

Aspect	Descriptive Statistics	Inferential Statistics
Definition	Summarizes and describes features of a dataset.	Draws conclusions and makes predictions about a population.
Purpose	To provide a summary of the data.	To make inferences about the population based on sample data.
Focus	Focuses on actual data collected.	Focuses on generalizations beyond the collected data.
Techniques	Measures like mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation.	Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis.
Data Usage	Uses the entire dataset.	Uses a sample of the dataset.
Uncertainty	No element of uncertainty; results are exact.	Contains uncertainty due to sampling error.
Graphs and Charts	Includes histograms, pie charts, bar graphs.	Rarely involves graphical representation.
Population vs. Sample	Deals with the dataset provided (sample or population).	Makes predictions about the entire population from the sample.
Mathematical Basis	Simple calculations and visualization.	Relies heavily on probability theory.
Examples	Average test scores of a class.	Predicting national average scores from a sample of schools.
Software Tools	Excel, Tableau, Power BI.	SPSS, R, Python (SciPy, statsmodels).
Hypothesis Testing	Not used.	Widely used.
Result Type	Concrete and specific.	Probabilistic and generalizable.
Requirement	Requires the full dataset.	Requires only a representative sample.
Scope	Limited to describing data.	Extends to making decisions and predictions.
